tasksToPush = non-fixed, incomplete tasks sorted by current startTime (ascending), with skippable tasks moved to the end
fixedTasks = fixed tasks, sorted by startTime

pointer = current time in minutes
DAY_END = 21 * 60 // e.g., 9:00 PM

// Auxiliary functions
- Convert all task times to minutes since midnight for processing

- Define function: isConflict(taskA, taskB)
    → returns true if taskA and taskB time ranges overlap

- Define function: findNextAvailableSlot(task, pointer, fixedTasks)
    → returns earliest non-conflicting startTime >= pointer

// Main logic
FOR each task in tasksToPush:
    newStart = findNextAvailableSlot(task, pointer, fixedTasks)
    
    IF newStart === null:
        task.startTime = null
        task.skipped = true
        CONTINUE

    task.startTime = newStart
    task.skipped = false
    pointer = newStart + task.duration

// Fallback sweep for skipped tasks
FOR time = current time to DAY_END:
    FOR each task in tasksToPush WHERE task.skipped == true:
        IF task can fit at 'time' without conflicting with fixedTasks or already scheduled tasks:
            task.startTime = time
            task.skipped = false
            BREAK
